            <p>This project came to our mind after we played Worms WMD for the first time. The game's fun, but the controls were archeic and the game was frustratingly unforgiving. We were set to make our own Worms "clone". I developped a nice dynamic physics-based terrain system for it, but the project got abandonned as I got busy from school.</p>
