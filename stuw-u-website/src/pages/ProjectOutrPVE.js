            <p>This project started off as an attempt to improve OUTERBLAST's terrain system, and then later turned into it's own PVE game. In this game, you fight off waves of flying angels on top of destructible floating islands. If you don't kill them quick enough, they'll destroy the land you stand on leading to your team's demise. If everyone's out, it's game over. To help your team you must dig in the ground for crates of item that will help you during the operation. If you survive the final wave, you get to keep your items and go on to the next area.</p>
            <p>Surviving a wave gets you a core that you can sell off for credits. Gather enough credits to buy furniture to decorate your home base, which happens to be the lobby.</p>
