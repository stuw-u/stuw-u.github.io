            <p>We wanted to make a kart game with a bunch of friend. I did a much of experimentation to try and replicate the kart controller of Mod Nation Racing as well as Mario Kart's. I also ensured the kart controller was down direction agnostic so it would handle the kind of anti-gravity behaviour that Mario Kart 8 has. The project ended up going nowhere, but the prototype's still pretty fun, altough a little janky.</p>
